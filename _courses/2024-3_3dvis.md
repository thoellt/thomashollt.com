This course builds upon the Data visualization course and extends the focus on scientific data, for example theory and practice of spatial data visualization such as medical scans or simulations. This includes the following aspects: data acquisition basics, clinical practice; image processing, e.g., filtering, segmentation, and measurement; medical volume visualization; illustrative visualization; advanced visualization for complex modalities; interaction techniques for 3D; advanced applications and specific requirements for different fields.
