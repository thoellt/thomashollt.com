Data visualization makes use of computer-generated images to gain insight and knowledge from data and its inherent patterns and relationships. Data visualizations use a combination of methods from a diverse variety of disciplines: perception, computer graphics, human computer interaction, algorithmics, image processing, machine learning, numerical analysis, optimization, and more.
This course covers are broad number of topics from approaches visualization and interaction design, based on robust research to corresponding algorithms.

Affinity to algorithmic thinking and programing skills will be needed. Projects will be implemented in [javascript/D3](https://d3js.org){:target="_blank"} and C++.
