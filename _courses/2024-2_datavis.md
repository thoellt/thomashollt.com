Data visualizations use a combination of methods from a diverse variety of disciplines: perception, computer graphics, human computer interaction, algorithmics, and more.
This course covers are broad number of topics from approaches visualization and interaction design, based on robust research to corresponding algorithms.

Affinity to algorithmic thinking and programing skills will be needed. The project will be implemented in [javascript/D3](https://d3js.org){:target="_blank"}.
