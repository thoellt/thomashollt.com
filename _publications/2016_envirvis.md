abstract: "Hydrocarbon reservoir simulation models produce large amounts of heterogeneous data, combining multiple variables of different dimensionality, such as two or three-dimensional geospatial estimates with abstract estimates simulated for the complete field or different wells. In addition these simulations are nowadays often run as so-called ensemble simulations, to capture uncertainty of the model, as well as boundary conditions as variation in the output. The (visual) analysis of such data is a challenging process, due to the size and complexity of the data. In this paper we present an integrated system for the visual analysis of ensemble reservoir simulation data. We provide tools to inspect forecasts for multiple variables of complete fields, as well as different wells. Finally, we present a case study highlighting the effectiveness of the presented system."
