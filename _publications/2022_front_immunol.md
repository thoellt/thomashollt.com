abstract: "Chronic intestinal inflammation underlies inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous studies indicated alterations in the cellular immune system; however, it has been challenging to interrogate the role of all immune cell subsets simultaneously. Therefore, we aimed to identify immune cell types associated with inflammation in IBD using high-dimensional mass cytometry. We analyzed 188 intestinal biopsies and paired blood samples of newly-diagnosed, treatment-naive patients (n=42) and controls (n=26) in two independent cohorts. We applied mass cytometry (36-antibody panel) to resolve single cells and analyzed the data with unbiased Hierarchical-SNE. In addition, imaging-mass cytometry (IMC) was performed to reveal the spatial distribution of the immune subsets in the tissue. We identified 44 distinct immune subsets. Correlation network analysis identified a network of inflammation-associated subsets, including HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> EM CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, T regulatory-like cells, PD1<sup>+</sup> EM CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, neutrophils, CD27<sup>+</sup> TCRγδ cells and NK cells. All disease-associated subsets were validated in a second cohort. This network was abundant in a subset of patients, independent of IBD subtype, severity or intestinal location. Putative disease-associated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were detectable in blood. Finally, imaging-mass cytometry revealed the spatial colocalization of neutrophils, memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and myeloid cells in the inflamed intestine. Our study indicates that a cellular network of both innate and adaptive immune cells colocalizes in inflamed biopsies from a subset of patients. These results contribute to dissecting disease heterogeneity and may guide the development of targeted therapeutics in IBD."
