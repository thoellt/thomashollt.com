abstract: "The ever-increasing number of analyzed cells in Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments imposes several challenges on the data analysis. Current analysis methods lack scalability to large datasets hampering interactive visual exploration of the data. We present Cytosplore-Transcriptomics, a framework to analyze scRNA-seq data, including data preprocessing, visualization and downstream analysis. At its core, it uses a hierarchical, manifold preserving representation of the data that allows the inspection and annotation of scRNA-seq data at different levels of detail. Consequently, Cytosplore-Transcriptomics provides interactive analysis of the data using low-dimensional visualizations that scales to millions of cells."
