abstract: "Medicine and biology are important research fields with a significant impact on humans and their health. In the last few decades, many visualization strategies have been pro- posed for solving problems within these disciplines. From the early molecular models and medical volume representations to modern-day visual analytics for genomics or extended reality applications for surgery training and guidance, the area of biomedical visualization has progressed and expanded considerably.
The goal of this book is to provide an overview of biomedical visualization by highlighting the overall trends of research through the years and the evolution of topics over time. To uncover these trends, we have manually curated a total of 3856 research publications related to biomedical visualization, which we categorized according to their application field. A searchable repository of these publications accompanies this book at https://biomedvis-book.fi.muni.cz/.
The topics we cover in this book include visualization research in omics, interaction networks and pathways, biological structures, tumor diagnosis and treatment, vasculature, brain, surgery, educational contexts, therapy and rehabilitation, electronic health records, and public health. A separate chapter is dedicated to general visualization techniques commonly used for biomedical data, such as surface and volume rendering, as well as abstract and illustrative approaches. For each of these areas, the past and contemporary research trends are discussed, highlighting the most influential works. Furthermore, the book explains how research is affected by developments in technology, data availability, and domain practice.
Moreover, we discuss visualization challenges that can be considered solved, as well as research directions anticipated to thrive in the upcoming years. We further include the outcomes of interviews conducted with 16 researchers in the field of biomedical visualization to solicit their opinions regarding the evolution and trends in the domain as well as the future of this research field.
We discuss the individual topics in a concise manner to help readers orient themselves in the already mature and diverse field of biomedical visualization without overwhelming them with technical details. We also provide useful pointers for future reading. As such, we hope that the book can help young researchers to become familiar with past challenges and identify future ones. For more senior researchers, we believe our book can serve as an insightful overview of the research field and the direction it is heading."
