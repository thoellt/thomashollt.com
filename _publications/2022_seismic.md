abstract: "In this chapter, we present research that deals with the rendering and processing of seismic volumes and unstructured reservoir grids. We focus on approaches that facilitate interactive workflows, i.e., real-time rendering of seismic data, as well as real-time extraction of seismic structures. This is enabled by the parallel processing power of graphics processing units (GPUs). The chapter consists of three parts. The first part introduces basic and established techniques for seismic volume and reservoir visualization. The second part discusses more experimental and advanced methods that are not (yet) common among geoscientists. The third part covers real-time methods for extracting objects and structures from seismic data."
