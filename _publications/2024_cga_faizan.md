abstract: "Fiber tracking is a powerful technique that provides insight into the brain's white matter structure. Despite its potential, the inherent uncertainties limit its widespread clinical use. These uncertainties potentially hamper the clinical decisions neurosurgeons have to make before, during, and after the surgery. Many techniques have been developed to visualize uncertainties, however, there is limited evidence to suggest whether these uncertainty visualization influences neurosurgical decision-making. In this paper, we evaluate the hypothesis that uncertainty visualization in fiber tracking influences neurosurgeon's decisions and the confidence in their decisions. For this purpose, we designed a user study through an online interactive questionnaire and evaluate the influence of uncertainty visualization in neurosurgical decision-making. The results of this study emphasize the importance of uncertainty visualization in clinical decision making by highlighting the influence of different interval of uncertainty visualization in critical clinical decisions."
